1. Use standard R Markdown.
2. Headings with "##" will be automatically turned into table of contents. Therefore, for longer tutorials please use this facility.
3. Check that R studio will knit into an HTML document.
4. You can contribute the .rmd file via GitHub (https://github.com/jonesor/learn-basta), **to the master branch ONLY**. To do that you must be a collaborator on the repository (contact me with your username), or you can fork the repository and send a pull request (https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
5. Alternatively you can email me the *rmd file and associated files (e.g. any figures/diagrams.)
6. I will then compile the site on my computer and push it to the gh-pages branch (which is where the website lives). You could also do this, but you will need to have Jekyll and pandoc installed.
